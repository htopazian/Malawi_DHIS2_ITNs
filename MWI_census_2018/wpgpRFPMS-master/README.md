# Introduction
wpgpRFPMS is a population modelling R script utilizing Random Forests to inform a dasymetric redistribution of census-based population count data. Read more about the method in [https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0107042](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0107042) 
All census data, zonal stats and covariates for 249 countries are stored on [WorldPop](http://www.worldpop.org.uk) FTP and downloaded into a project by using the R package [wpgpCovariates](https://github.com/wpgp/wpgpCovariates)
